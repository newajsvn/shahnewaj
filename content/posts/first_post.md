# This is a head
Hello,
My name is Shah Newaj (I have a bigger legal name though). Welcome to my portal. I have decided to not get my domain for now. That's why I'm posting through the GitHub domain.

# This is another head
I will try to write my updates here, and some documentation that I have to keep coming back, and hope they'll be helpful for others too. Moreover, you will find my projects listed somewhere, not sure where should I put them yet.
I will try to write them as concise as possible.

Besides, I am going to make some videos for my [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/@nukapasta) channel [Nukapasta](https://www.youtube.com/@nukapasta)
